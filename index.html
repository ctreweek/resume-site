       <h4><u>My Story</u></h4>
       <p>Over the course of the past few months, I have changed my focus from linguistics and Middle Eastern Studies to full-stack web development. What began as an exploration of coding in my free time quickly developed into a complete fascination with computer programming, as my passion for studying and analyzing language translated directly into an obessession with Ruby.</p>
       <p>As a developer, I truly enjoy the process of envisioning a project as a whole and breaking it down into small, manageable pieces in order to achieve my vision. Given my background as a language enthusiast with experience translating large texts, I understand the importance of approaching a task one step at a time as a means of reaching a larger goal.</p>
       <p>From my time as a competitive athlete and coach, I embrace teamwork and collaboration and take pride in my ability to communicate effectively with others. Moreover, as someone who has lived and traveled in cultures vastly different from my own, I appreciate diversity in opinion and perspective and strive to incorporate these ideals into my work as a developer.</p>

   <h5>get.inked</h5>
   <p>get.inked is a team-built, fullstack, 11-model Ruby on Rails app using HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, OmniAuth, Instagram API, and Action Cable. Deployed via Heroku.</p>
   <p>It is a mobile-first application that acts as a platform for tattoo artists to share their work by signing up with Instagram and selecting which photos they would like to add to their profile, as well as setting their availability. On the other side of the coin, get.inked allows for tattoo seekers to browse both work and artists based on location and style, book an appointment, message with the artist, pay a deposit once the appointment has been confirmed, and review their artist.</p>
   <p>One of the biggest challenges during this project was working with the Instagram API. We encountered a lot of difficulty with the access token and allowing multiple users to sign in with Instagram. Given that it is an 11-model app, developing the schema and establishing associations was also a challenging part of the process. We often found ourselves migrating to add or remove columns from tables as we went along. </p>

  <p>*As we are still in the process of making the app responsive, it is best experienced when inspected and viewed in iPhone 6 plus format. While it is possible to search for multiple city/style combinations, not every city has a style seeded for it at this point. I therefore recommend searching "Barcelona/Traditional" in order to most efficiently go through the user journey!</p>
